Feature: Added ID's for text blocks
In order to change the settings of a block
As an admin
I need to be able to click on delete and config of a block

Scenario: Clicking ID's (Bug 1428456)
 Given I log in as "admin" with password "Password1"
 And I follow "Portfolio"
 And I follow "Profile page"
 And I follow "Edit this page"

 # Checking if we can add a block
 And I follow "Text"
 And I press "Add"
 And I wait "1" seconds
 And I set the following fields to these values:
 | Block title | Ulysses |
 | Block content | <p>Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed ...</p> |
 And I press "Save"
 Then I should see "Buck Mulligan"

 # Checking if we can edit a block
 When I configure the block "About me"
 And I set the following fields to these values:
 | Introduction text | <p>A James Joyce fan</p> |
 And I press "Save"
 Then I should see "James Joyce"

 # Checking if we can delete a block
 When I delete the block "Ulysses"
 Then I should not see "Buck Mulligan"
